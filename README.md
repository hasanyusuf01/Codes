## Text classification
Welcome to this notebook where I have created a deep neural network to classify MNIST handwritten digit images. MNIST is widely considered the "Hello World" of deep learning, and building a model on this dataset is an essential step for beginners.

Using the Keras library, I was able to gain a better understanding of the underlying concepts and techniques used in deep learning. It was an exciting and enriching experience to build a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits.

I hope this notebook can be a valuable resource for those looking to understand and build deep neural networks. With the knowledge gained from this project, one can explore further and tackle more challenging problems in the field of machine learning.
